# Ottomotive

Ottomotive is a mock sharing-economy company with a mission of empowering those who don't have access to cars with an opportunity to make an income! We used Smartcar's API to access information from smart cars to create the interface for a web application that would allow its users to grant other users access to their vehicle in order to drive or Uber, Lyft, or for another ridesharing or diving company, earning income for themselves as well as those who are renting out their cars. 

## Getting Started


You will need:  
1.) Download the 'Ottomotive' file on the resository page<br />
2.) Download 'pythonsdkmaster' file on repsitory<br />
3.) Install Pip:  
    - If you’re using Python 2.7.9 (or greater) or Python 3.4 (or greater), then PIP comes installed with Python by default. If you’re          using an older version of Python, you’ll need to use the installation described in this link<br />                                        https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages
4.) Install tornado using pip in Termianl useing the command:  
    - >>> pip install tornado<br />
5.) You will also need to know your <br />
