# Ottomotive

Ottomotive is a mock sharing-economy company with a mission of empowering those who don't have access to cars with an opportunity to make an income! We used Smartcar's API to access information from smart cars to create the interface for a web application that would allow its users to grant other users access to their vehicle in order to drive or Uber, Lyft, or for another ridesharing or diving company, earning income for themselves as well as those who are renting out their cars. 

## Getting Started


You will need:  
1.) Download the 'Ottomotive' file from the repsitory<br />
2.) Download 'pythonsdkmaster' file from the repsitory<br />
3.) Install PIP:  If you’re using Python 2.7.9 (or greater) or Python 3.4 (or greater), then PIP comes installed with Python by default. If you’re using an older version of Python, you’ll need to use the installation described in this link<br />                       https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages<br /><br />
4.) Install tornado using pip in Termianl using the command:  
    >>> pip install tornado<br /><br />
5.) You will also need to know your <br />
    - Client ID<br />
    - Client Secret<br />
    - Redirect URIs<br />
    
    Which can all be found once you create an account with Smartcar at https://smartcar.com/
<br />
### Installing
<br />
In Termnal:<br />
1.) Cd to the directoy where the file is saved:<br />
2.) Begin the program<br /><br />

For Example, If I had saved both 'Ottomotive' and 'pythonsdkmaster' to my desktop, to begin the program I would run the command:

```
>>> cd '/Users/darrelm/Desktop/Ottomotive/'
>>> python3 run.py
```
## Running The Program   <--- i added this<br />

2.) You will be prompted to log into you vehicle makers account<br />
3.) You will be redirected to our Ottomotive web application which will then display the information for your vehicle<br />
